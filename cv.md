## General Information

I studied front-end development under the guidance of mentors from the Unscholer.me organization. This course included mastering the languages ​​HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES 6) and TypeScript, as well as the React framework. To study the material, I also used information from the educational site [learnjavascript.ru] (https://learn.javascript.ru/), technical documentation on React [reactgs.org] (https: //ru.reactjs. Org /), video materials for React ([Udemy] (https://www.udemy.com), [It-Incubator] (https://it-incubator.by/React-online.html), etc.)

I practice my practical skills on my own project “My Social Network”.

This project uses the following technologies: Redux, Redux Thunk, React Hooks, Rest API, third-party libraries: Formic and Ant Design. The project was transferred to TypeScript.

I want to get new and develop existing knowledge and skills in order to become a professional in the field of Full Stack development.
